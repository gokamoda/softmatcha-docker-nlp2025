Abstract

Given the growing use of Large Language Models(LLMs) in diverse cultural contexts, this study examinestheir adaptability to Japanese workplace norms using Hof-stede’s Cultural Dimensions Framework.
Five multilingualLLMs from Japanese, English, and Chinese backgroundswere tested with prompts reﬂecting six cultural dimensions,and their outputs were analyzed for alignment through sen-timent analysis.
Results reveal varying levels of culturalalignment, with models reﬂecting biases tied to their train-ing contexts.
The study highlights the importance of di-verse and culturally representative datasets to improve theadaptability of LLMs in speciﬁc cultural settings.


1 Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed nat-ural language processing (NLP), excelling in applicationssuch as machine translation, text summarization, and con-versational AI.
However, the vast multilingual datasets usedfor their training often carry cultural and linguistic biases,which subsequently manifest in the models’ outputs.
Thisphenomenon, known as “stereotype leakage,” highlightshow biases in one language can inﬂuence outputs in others,raising concerns about the fair ness and cultural adaptabilityof LLMs in diverse contexts
[1].Cultural adaptability is particularly important in con-texts where societal norms shape human interactions, suchas workplace communication.
Hofstede’s Cultural Dimen-sions Theory oﬀers a robust framework for analyzing thesesocietal values, categorizing them across six dimensions:• Power Distance Index (PDI):
Measures the accep-tance of unequal power distribution in a society.
Figure 1 Examples of LLM responses to an IDV-basedprompt, showing the Japanese model balance goals, the Westernmodels favor individualism, and the Chinese models emphasizecollectivism.• Individualism vs. Collectivism (IDV):
Reﬂects theemphasis on individual goals versus group objectives.•
Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI): Indicates a so-ciety’s tolerance for ambiguity and uncertainty.• Masculinity vs. Femininity (MAS): Assesses pref-erences for competition and achievement versus co-operation and quality of life.• Long-Term Orientation vs. Short-Term Orienta-tion (LTO): Examines the prioritization of future re-wards over immediate results.• Indulgence vs. Restraint (IND):
Measures societalregulation of human desires and enjoyment
[2].This study focuses on Japanese workplace culture as atest case to evaluate the cultural adaptability of multilingualLLMs.
Five models were selected based on their diversecultural and linguistic training backgrounds (Japanese, En-glish, and Chinese backgrounds) and prompts based onworkplace scenarios in Japan were designed to generateTable 1 Brief descriptions of the Japanese workplace prompts associated with each Hofstede’s cultural dimension and the corre-sponding sentiment orientation of LLM outputs.

By examining Japanese workplace nor ms through Hof-stede’s framework, this study investigates the cultural bi-ases and adaptability of LLMs.
The ﬁndings aim to as-sess whether these models can eﬀectively represent cultur-ally speciﬁc norms despite their multilingual training.
AsLLMs become integral to global applications, addressingcultural adaptability remains a cr itical challenge and a keyarea for future research.

3 Methods

LLMs We selected ﬁve state-of-the-art multilingualLLMs from three distinct cultural contexts:
LLM-jp
[10](Japanese background); GPT-4o
[11] and Llama 3.1 [12](English background);
Qwen 2.5
[13] and GLM 4
[14](Chinese background).
These models were chosen basedon their documented training datasets, encompassing di-verse linguistic and cultural features.
Prompts Prompts were crafted to simulate typicalJapanese workplace scenarios, incorporating key culturalaspects such as hierarchical respect, group harmony, anddecision-making processes.
Each prompt was designedto reﬂect one of Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, ensuringtargeted evaluation of the models’ ability to align withJapanese cultural expectations.
All prompts were writtenin Japanese to maintain linguistic consistency and maxi-mize the authenticity of the simulated scenarios.
For eachprompt, all ﬁve LLMs generated 50 responses in Japaneseto ensure robustness and account for variability.
Detailedprompts and selected responses for the IDV dimensionare available in Appendix A.1.
Generated outputs wereanalyzed for sentiment polarity using ML-Ask [15], a sen-timent analysis tool designed for Japanese text.
Sentiment analysis Sentiments were categorized aspositive, mostly positive, neutral, mostly negative, or nega-tive and mapped to Hofstede’s cultural dimensions througha framework grounded in cultural psychology.
Emotionalresponses reﬂect the congruence and conﬂict between be-haviors and cultually norms.
For instance, in high PDIcultures, positive sentiments align with hierarchical re-spect and deference to authority, while negative sentimentssuggest resistance to such norms.
Similarly, in high UAIcultures, negative sentiments indicate discomfort with am-biguity, reﬂecting a preference for clar ity and structure.
These mappings are supported by cultural psychology the-ories
[16] and the context-speciﬁc deﬁnitions of Hofstede’sdimensions [17].
Table 1 provides a summary of the briefdescriptions of these prompts, along with the sentimentanalysis results and their corresponding interpretations.


4 Results and Discussion

To evaluate the cultural adaptability of LLMs in Japaneseworkplace scenarios, we analyzed the sentiment distribu-tions of model outputs across the six cultural dimensions.
For contextual reference, Hofstede’s cultural dimensionsscores for Japan, the United States (US), and China aresummarized in Table 2
[18].
These scores provide a base-line to understand the cultural inclinations of each countryand their potential inﬂuence on the models’ training data.
Fig. 2 shows the sentiment distribution of outputs acrossHofstede’s six cultural dimensions for the ﬁve LLMs.
PDI Japan’s moderate PDI score (54) reﬂects a work-place culture that balances respect for authority and collec-tive input.
GLM generated the highest number of PositiveTable 2 Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions Scores for Japan, theUS, and China
[18], which provided the baseline for this study.

Qwenfollowed closely, similarly aligning with hierarchical val-ues but showing slightly fewer Positive outputs.
GPT-4oalso produced predominantly Positive outputs, indicatingrecognition of hierarchical respect despite its Western back-ground.
LLM-jp, while aligning with Japan’s workplacenorms, showed fewer Positive outputs.
Llama exhibitedstrong Positive outputs, further demonstrating unexpectedalignment with hierarchical respect.
IDV Japan’s collectivist orientation (IDV: 46) empha-sizes group harmony over individualism.
LLM-jp leanedtoward individualism, with Positive outputs exceeded Neg-ative ones.
Qwen balanced Positive and Negative outputsmore eﬀectively, aligning better with collectivist workplacenorms.
In contrast, GPT-4o and Llama showed a strongpreference for individualistic values, consistent with West-ern cultural inﬂuences.
GLM exhibited mixed tenden-cies, reﬂecting a slight divergence from China’s collectivistbackground (IDV: 20).UAI Japan’s high UAI score (92) reﬂects a strong pref-erence for structure and aversion to ambiguity.
LLM-jpaligned well with these traits, producing predominantlyNegative outputs, indicating discomfort with uncertainty.
Qwen, while also leaning toward Negative outputs, showedslightly more Neutral and Positive sentiments, indicatingweaker alignment with Japan’s strong aversion to ambi-guity.
GLM, with its Neutral-heavy responses, displayedan even lower emphasis on risk aversion.
GPT-4o
andLlama leaned Neutral, with Llama showing more Negativeoutputs.
MAS Japan’s high MAS score (95) reﬂects a compet-itive and achievement-oriented workplace culture GPT-4ocaptured this dynamic most strongly, with the highest Pos-itive outputs.
Qwen and GLM, while producing notablePositive outputs, leaned heavily toward Neutral responses,diluting their alignment with competitive values.
In con-trast, LLM-jp skewed Negative, underrepresenting Japan’sassertive workplace norms.
Llama displayed mixed ten-dencies, balancing Positive, Neutral, and Negative senti-ments.
LTO Japan’s high LTO score (88) reﬂects a strong fo-cus on long-term planning and future beneﬁts.
LLM-jpand Llama strongly aligned, with predominantly Negativeoutputs reﬂecting long-term values.
Qwen, while similar,Figure 2 Sentiment distribution of outputs across Hofstede’s six cultural dimensions (PDI, IDV, UAI, MAS, LTO, and IND) for theﬁve LLMs (LLM-jp, Llama, GPT-4o, Qwen, and GLM).

GLM favored Positive outputs, reﬂecting short-termorientation, while GPT-4o displayed a balanced mix ofPositive and Negative sentiments.
IND Japan’s low IND score (42) reﬂects a restrainedculture valuing moderation over indulgence.
LLM-JPleaned Positive while maintaining notable Neutral outputs,aligning partially with Japan’s restrained norms.
Qwenleaned more Positive, showing a slight indulgence ten-dency.
GLM, with a higher Neutral proportion, alignedwith restraint.
In contrast, GPT-4o and Llama producedoverwhelmingly Positive outputs, reﬂecting indulgence-oriented values inconsistent with Japan’s cultural context.
The ﬁndings reveal varying cultural adaptability amongLLMs.
LLM-jp aligned well with Japan’s UAI and LTO butunderperformed in MAS and PDI, showing gaps in reﬂect-ing Japan’s competitive and hierarchical nuances.
Qwenbalanced collectivist and hierarchical values but leaned to-ward indulgence, diverging slightly from Japan’s restraint.
GLM captured restraint well but showed weak alignmentin LTO and MAS, favoring short-term and neutral stances.
GPT-4o and Llama, inﬂuenced by Western norms, leanedtoward individualism and indulgence but performed unex-pectedly well in PDI and MAS, highlighting their adapt-ability in high-context scenarios.
Limitations
This study has several limitations.
First,the evaluation relies heavily on sentiment analysis, whichmay not capture the full depth of cultural nuance present inLLM outputs.
Sentiment polarity (positive, neutral, nega-tive) simpliﬁes complex cultural values and may miss sub-tler aspects of workplace norms.
Second, the prompts usedto evaluate the models are restricted to Japanese workplacescenarios, potentially limiting the generalizability of ﬁnd-ings to other cultural or professional contexts.
Third, whileHofstede’s framework provides a structured approach forcultural analysis, it may oversimplify the diversity withinJapanese workplace culture, which varies by industry, re-gion, and organizational size.
Lastly, the lack of qualitativehuman evaluations limits the interpretability and validationof the sentiment analysis results.


5 Conclusion

This study demonstrates that while LLMs can generateculturally aligned outputs, their performance varies acrossHofstede’s cultural dimensions.
LLM-jp excels in UAI andLTO, aligning well with Japan’s structured, future-focusedworkplace norms.
However, its limited Positive outputs inPDI and MAS gaps in reﬂecting Japan’s hierarchical andcompetitive cultural traits.
GPT-4o and Llama displayedadaptability but leaned heavily toward individualistic andindulgent values, diverging from Japan’s collectivist andrestrained cultural context.
Qwen and GLM, while produc-ing balanced outputs, often lacked the cultural speciﬁcityseen in LLM-jp.
The ﬁndings emphasize the need for domain-speciﬁcﬁne-tuning and culturally rich datasets to improve LLMs’alignment with speciﬁc cultural norms.
Future researchshould explore qualitative evaluations and broader profes-sional contexts to validate and extend these results.
AsLLMs become integral in cross-cultural applications, en-suring cultural adaptability will remain a critical area ofinquiry.

A Appendix



A.1 Examples of LLMs’ responses

This appendix presents the IDV dimension prompt andthe corresponding responses generated by LLM-jp, Llama3.1, and Qwen 2.5 models.
Prompt At the company’s annual review meeting,Sato’s team is asked to propose a business plan for thecoming year.
The team leader suggests that everyone sharetheir thoughts on the team’s objectives as well as their per-sonal priorities.
Sato feels that his focus this year maynot fully align with the team’s overall goals, and he isconcerned that his ideas might not beneﬁt the team.
Ashe begins to speak, he tries to strike a balance betweenhis personal career goals and the team’s needs.
How willSato’s colleagues respond to his proposal?
How will hebalance collective objectives with individual ambitions?LLM-jp When Sato proposed the team’s business planfor the coming year, his colleagues respected his approachand anticipated a balance between individual ambitionsand team goals.
As Sato shared his ideas, he began byreaﬃrming the team’s objectives and then explained howhis personal career goals could contribute to the team’ssuccess.
For instance, if Sato wanted to leverage his exper-tise in a speciﬁc project, it would be important for him todemonstrate how the project aligns with the team’s overallgoals while also beneﬁting his personal career growth.
Sato’s colleagues carefully considered his proposal andshowed a willingness to collaborate in ﬁnding ways to ben-eﬁt both the team’s objectives and individual ambitions.
They understood that Sato prioritized the team’s successwhile welcoming suggestions that also foster individual de-velopment.
For example, if Sato proposed a project thatenhanced the team’s skill set and laid the foundation for fu-ture growth, such a proposal would be positively received.
Ultimately, with the team’s support, Sato developed aplan that balanced his personal ambitions with the team’sobjectives.
Through this process, he demonstrated leader-ship and played a role in boosting the team’s morale.
If hisproposal proved successful, Sato could expect progress inhis career while the team as a whole achieved signiﬁcantoutcomes.
Llama 3.1 Sato took a deep breath and began speak-ing to the team leader.
“The team’s goals are important,but this year, I’d like to focus on balancing my personalcareer goals with the team’s needs.
My proposal is to alignthis year’s priorities with both the team’s objectives andindividual goals, so that we can achieve the team’s overalltargets while fostering personal career growth.
”As
the team members listened to Sato’s statement, theybegan to exchange ideas.
The team leader evaluated Sato’sproposal.
“It seems that Sato’s approach considers thebalance between the team’s overall goals and individualcareer objectives.
I believe it’s crucial to nurture personalcareers in order to achieve the team’s objectives.
”The
team members started to deliberate on Sato’s sug-gestion.
They agreed to set this year’s priorities by consid-ering both the team’s goals and individual career aspira-tions.
The team leader recognized the importance of sup-porting personal career development to achieve the team’sgoals and approved Sato’s proposal.
Sato was appreciated by the team members and the teamleader for his focus on balancing team objectives and in-dividual career goals.
He decided to collaborate with theteam members to foster personal career growth while work-ing towards achieving the team’s objectives.
Qwen 2.5 Sato took a deep breath and gathered theattention of all his team members.
“I’d like to hear every-one’s opinions,” he began.
“We each have our own goals,but they may not always align perfectly with the team’s ob-jectives.
However, as long as we work together, I believewe should support each other’s success.
”Sato’s words resonated quietly among the team mem-bers.
His statement reﬂected the spirit of wa in Japanesebusiness culture, emphasizing harmony and collaborationover individual goals.
One of the team members, Li, agreed with his perspec-tive.
“Sato-san, you’re absolutely right.
We all have per-sonal goals, but they should serve the purpose of achievingthe team’s objectives.
”Meanwhile, Marie, who hails from the United States,interpreted Sato’s suggestion from a slightly diﬀerent per-spective.
“I agree with your opinion, Sato-san, but I alsobelieve individual growth is important.
We want to succeedas a team, but we also want to grow as individuals.
”Sato felt satisﬁed that his proposal reﬂected the opinionsof all the team members.
He promised to adjust his plan tobalance his personal ambitions with the team’s needs andto ﬁnd a solution that ever yone could agree on.
