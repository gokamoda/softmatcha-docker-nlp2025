Abstract

Self-Correction enables Large Language Models(LLMs) to reﬁne their responses during inference basedon feedback.
While prior research mainly examines theimpact of Self-Correction on reasoning tasks such as arith-metic reasoning, its inﬂuence on debiasing remains un-derexplored.
In this work, we propose a Self-Correctionframework tailored to bias evaluation task and demonstratethat the approach has potential in debiasing LLMs’ re-sponses more robustly and consistently than the baselines,which are Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency.
Wealso conﬁrm that factors such as the feedback source, thebias level of the feedback generator, and the social biascategories signiﬁcantly inﬂuence debiasing outcomes.


1 Introduction

Nowadays, several frameworks have been proposed toenhance the reasoning capabilities and faithfulness ofLarge Language Models (LLMs) during inference.
Asa prompting method, Chain-of-Thought (CoT)[1, 2] isused to stimulate models to generate step-by-step reason-ing chains toward a ﬁnal answer.
Then, approaches thatinvolve enabling repetitive inference calls and selectingthe most likely answer emerged [3, 4].
As a current main-stream, frameworks for iterative response reﬁnement havebeen proposed to further enhance LLMs’ reasoning.
Self-Correction
[5] is an approach that enables LLMs to reﬁnetheir responses during inference based on feedback, whichcan be derived from the same LLM, a diﬀerent LLM, or ex-ternal tools and knowledge sources.
Numerous studies haveshown that Self-Correction signiﬁcantly improves LLMs’performance in reasoning tasks such as arithmetic reason-ing and code generation [6, 7].
In contrast, some studiesFigure 1 Self-Correction framework for bias evaluation task:1) response generation, 2) feedback generation, 3) reﬁnementhighlight potential limitations, including the perpetuationof LLMs’ biases to their responses [8], and suggest that theapproach is ineﬀective without external feedback
[9].For bias-related reasoning tasks, prior studies havedemonstrated that CoT alone is insuﬃcient to mitigate bi-ased responses eﬀectively, with current best practices in-volving the use of explicit debiasing instructions [10, 11,12].
Nevertheless, the impact of Self-Correction on debias-ing remains unclear.
While this approach might potentiallydetect and correct biased reasoning, it could persist due tothe inherent biases within LLMs themselves.
In this work, we investigate how Self-Correction meth-ods aﬀect LLMs’ debiasing capability.
First, we carefullydesign a Self-Correction framework for bias evaluationtask and the settings to evaluate LLMs’ debiasing capa-bility.
Then, we evaluate models in GPT and LLaMAfamilies through nine social bias categories in BBQ task,and demonstrate that Self-Correction has the potential tomitigate social bias more robustly and consistently thanbaseline reasoning methods like CoT and Self-Consistency.
In addition, we discuss how the source of feedback, levelof bias in the feedback generator, and social bias categoriesinﬂuence the eﬀectiveness of Self-Correction.


2 Related Work

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting.
AlthoughCoT has been shown to improve LLMs in various com-plex reasoning tasks such as arithmetic reasoning
[1, 2],several studies demonstrate that CoT alone is insuﬃcientfor debiasing [10, 11].
The current best practice involvescombining CoT with explicit debiasing instructions, suchas “Please ensure that your answer is unbiased and does notrely on stereotypes”
[10, 11, 12].
In this work, we explorewhether integrating Self-Correction with CoT can providea more robust and consistent debiasing capability.
Self-Consistency (SC).
SC is an approach in whichmultiple inferences are generated from the same input, andthe most frequently produced answer is selected as the ﬁnalanswer [3].
Although SC has shown to improve reasoningtasks such as arithmetic and commonsense reasoning, it isunclear whether the approach contributes in LLMs’ debias-ing.
Following Kamoi et al.
[5], we adopt SC as a baselinefor comparison with Self-Correction, as both approachesinvolve multiple calls to LLMs.
To our knowledge, we arethe ﬁrst to investigate the impact of SC on debiasing.
Self-Correction.
There are multiple deﬁnitions ofSelf-Correction.
This work deﬁnes Self-Correction as aprocess where an LLM reﬁnes its response during infer-ence based on a feedback [5].
Feedback can be categorizedas either internal, generated by the same model that pro-duces the response, or external, derived from other models,humans, external tools, or knowledge sources.
Speciﬁ-cally, we focus on Self-Reﬁne (SR)[6], a Self-Correctionmethod using internal feedback, and Multi-Agent Debate(MAD)[7], which employs external feedback provided bydiﬀerent models.
While some studies demonstrate thatinternal feedback in Self-Correction improves reasoningabilities
[6, 13, 14], others repor t conﬂicting results, high-lighting the model’s limited capacity for accurate self-assessment [8, 9].
In contrast, the use of external feed-back has shown consistently positive eﬀects on reasoningperformance [7, 8].
In the context of debiasing, Qi etal.
[15] demonstrated that the individual use of CoT or ex-ternal feedback improves debiasing, but combining themtogether can have a negative impact due to conﬂict betweenthe model’s internal knowledge and external feedback.
Inthis work, we propose a feedback generation setting thatresolves the issue of using CoT with external feedback, andwe expand the investigation to the usage of internal andexternal feedback from the model of the same type.


3 Proposed Evaluation Method



3.1 Self-Correction Framework for Bias



Evaluation

Self-Correction consists of four main steps: responsegeneration, feedback generation, reﬁnement, and termina-tion.
Here, we propose the settings for each step for biasevaluation task.
Figure 1 describes the overall framework,and Appendix A includes all the instructions used.1.
Response generation For this step, we provideinstructions on the task for the response, the answeringformat, and the bias evaluation question.
We use zero-shot CoT prompting without debiasing instruction in thisstep to ensure that the generated text reﬂects the responsegenerator’s actual bias accurately.2.
Feedback generation We curate an instructionand provide 3-shot examples for the feedback generator.
Following Madaan et al.
[6], we design an instruction thatdescribes what aspects should be considered in the feed-back.
We newly deﬁne three aspects so that the feedbackgenerator, without relying on its bias, evaluates whetherthe response’s reasoning is valid.
There are:•
Coherent: Does the reasoning follow a logical struc-ture, and does the answer choice align with the logic?• Comprehensive: Does the response overlook any im-portant information from the context that could aﬀectthe reasoning?• Objective:
Is the response based on only the givencontext infor mation, and does it contain any presump-tions regarding social stereotypes?Then, we instruct the feedback generator to assign a scoreof 0 or 1 for each aspect, and also provide a total score.
Weinclude 3-shot examples to ensure that the output formatof feedback is correct.
Each few-shot example contains abias evaluation question, a response provided by LLM, anda feedback provided by the authors.3.
Reﬁnement We provide an instruction on the re-ﬁnement task, the answering format, the question, the pre-vious response, and the feedback.
We intentionally men-tion in the instr uction that the previous response has beengenerated by the response generator itself.4.
Termination To prevent unnecessary reﬁnement,the feedback-reﬁnement iteration will be terminated whenthe evaluation score given by the feedback is a perfect score,or when the number of iterations has reached the limit.


3.2 Data and Metrics

Data.
Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ)[16] is a bench-mark for evaluating social bias in LLMs along nine dimen-sions such as gender, nationality, and religion.
Each exam-ple contains a context, a question, and three answer choices.
The contexts will be either ambiguous or disambiguated.
Ambiguous context is when there is insuﬃcient contextinformation to decide which individual is the answer to thequestion, so ‘unknown’ is the correct, non-biased answer.
In contrast, disambiguated contexts provide adequate in-formation to identify a speciﬁc individual as the answer.
In this work, we use only ambiguous context examples inevaluating LLMs’ debiasing capability because the changesin accuracy in this context have a more direct and inter-pretable relationship with bias levels.
Then, we subsamplethe data to balance the number of examples per questiontemplate, resulting in a dataset of 2,118 examples across thenine bias categories.
With balanced data, a change in biasscore will be less sensitive to speciﬁc question templates.
Additional details are in Appendix B.Metrics.
We adopt accuracy and diﬀ-bias score fromJin et al.
[17] to evaluate LLMs’ debiasing capability.
First,a higher accuracy in solving ambiguous contexts indicatesa more answer of ‘unknown’, which is a non-biased answer.
Then, for diﬀ-bias score, it is deﬁned as:Diﬀ-bias =𝑛𝑏− 𝑛𝑐𝑏𝑛total(1)where 𝑛totalindicates a total number of examples, and𝑛𝑏, 𝑛𝑐𝑏indicates the number of biased answers andTable 1 Results from applying diﬀerent reasoning methodson LLMs in BBQ (9 categories).
“MAD (X)” indicates usingX as a feedback generator, which is a separate instance fromthe response generator.
Bold and underlined values indicate thebest and second best average accuracies/diﬀ-bias scores at eachresponse generator setting, respectively.

A higher diﬀ-biasscore indicates a g reater alignment of biases to socialstereotypes in the model.
In summary, we observe thechange in accuracy to conﬁrm if there is more or less socialbias after applying a reasoning method.
Then, we observethe change in diﬀ-bias score to conﬁrm if the remainingbias aligns more or less to social stereotypes.


4 Experiments

We conduct bias evaluation by BBQ task on GPT-3.5(turbo-0125), GPT-4o-mini (2024-07-18), and LlaMA-3-70b-instruct1）to examine how Self-Correction aﬀectsLLMs’ debiasing capability compared to baselines.


4.1 Settings

We prepare three baselines.
First, in No-CoT, we in-struct the model to provide only the answer in a speciﬁedformat.
Then, in CoT, we also instruct the model to provideat least one sentence of explanation and append the prompt“Let’s think step by step” [1].
Finally, Self-Consistency(SC) is a baseline method that involves multiple LLM calls1）

We use the response from CoT andobtain three more responses by repeating the inferences,then select the majority answer as a ﬁnal answer.
For Self-Correction, we experiment on two methods:Self-Reﬁne (SR) and Multi-Agent Debate (MAD).
In SR,the same model instance is used in both response and feed-back generation.
In MAD, diﬀerent model instances areused in response and feedback generation.
Notably, al-though there are cases where the response and feedbackgenerators in MAD are the same model type, they possessdiﬀerent conversation contexts.
Similarly to SC, we use theCoT output as an initial response, then iteratively promptthe model to generate feedback and a reﬁned response.
Weset the maximum number of reﬁnement iterations to three.


4.2 Results

Results from all Categories.
Table 1 shows the ag-gregated accuracies and diﬀ-bias scores from evaluatingLLMs in all BBQ bias categories at varying methods.
Atthe same response generator, SR and MAD yield the high-est accuracies and the lowest diﬀ-bias scores, indicatingtheir best debiasing capabilities for both biases that alignand do not align with social stereotypes.
MAD performsdebiasing better than SR when the feedback generator is amodel of the same type as the response generator or is aless biased model.
We hypothesize that in SR, the modelcould be more likely to generate feedback that supports itsresponse, thus resulting in inferior debiasing.
Addition-ally, relying on feedback from a more biased model mightshow no improvement or even amplify the bias in responsegeneration, as when GPT-4o-mini or LlaMA-3 is used as aresponse generator and GPT-3.5 as a feedback generator.
Among baselines, No-CoT yields higher accuracies andlower diﬀ-bias scores than the case of using only CoT,emphasizing that using CoT alone is not suﬃcient for debi-asing.
The trend is consistent with the ﬁndings by Turpinet al.
[10] and Shaikh et al.
[11].
Moreover, the improve-ment of SC from CoT is minimal and still underperformsNo-CoT, indicating that relying on the model’s most con-sistent output is still insuﬃcient for debiasing.
Notably,Self-Correction can perform debiasing more robustly thanSC at the same amount of response generations.
Results by Category.
Table 2 shows the accuraciesand diﬀ-bias scores of GPT-4o-mini evaluated on varyingBBQ categories and reasoning methods.
Self-Reﬁne andMAD yield higher accuracies and lower diﬀ-bias scoresin all categories, showing the consistent positive eﬀectof Self-Correction methods on debiasing on a wide rangeof social bias types.
Notably, the debiasing is eﬀectiveeven in the model’s highly biased categories, such as ageand disability status.
However, as the accuracy gains inMAD vary from 2% to 24% and 4% to 38% comparedto No-CoT and CoT across all categories, respectively, itcan be inferred that the eﬀectiveness of Self-Correction indebiasing is sensitive to social bias types.


5 Conclusion

This work proposes a Self-Cor rection framework forbias evaluation tasks to investigate how the approach af-fects LLMs’ debiasing capability.
We demonstrated thatLLMs have the potential to debias themselves with Self-Correction more robustly and consistently than existingbaselines like CoT prompting and Self-Consistency.
Wealso conﬁrmed that the debiasing further improves frominternal feedback with external feedback from an equallyless biased model.
Finally, although the eﬀectiveness issensitive to social bias categories, the debiasing capabilitycan be seen regardless of how initially biased the model is.

Table 4 shows prompt formats for response gener-ation, feedback generation, and reﬁnement steps in Self-Correction.
Table 5 shows an example of few-shot ex-amples used in feedback generation.
We use both BBQexamples from ambiguous and disambiguated contexts toensure that both unknown and speciﬁc answers are shownin the examples.
We also ensure that the selected BBQexamples are not from the same category used in the eval-uation.

B Evaluation Data Preparation

There are 11 data categories in BBQ dataset, which are:age, disability status, gender identity, nationality, physicalappearance, race/ethnicity, religion, socio-economic status(SES), sexual orientation, race+SES, and race+gender.
Weuse the nine independent categories and leave out the lasttwo intersectional categories to conduct separate analysesof debiasing across dimensions.
Each data category con-tains 25 to 50 unique question templates, with the numberof ambiguous examples per template varying from 4 to 300.To ensure a balanced dataset, we create a subset of BBQwith 4 to 8 examples per template, resulting in a dataset of2,118 examples across the nine categories.
