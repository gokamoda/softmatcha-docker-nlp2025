Abstract

This study proposes a novel framework for evaluatingLarge Language Models (LLMs) by uncovering their ideo-logical biases through a quantitative analysis of 436 binary-choice questions.
Applying the framework to ChatGPT andGemini, we found that while both models show consistentopinions, their ideologies diﬀer between models and lan-guages.
Both models also exhibited problematic biases,with some responses potentially having negative societalimpacts.
These ﬁndings highlight the need to address ide-ological and ethical considerations in LLM evaluation, andthe proposed framework oﬀers a ﬂexible method for assess-ing LLM behavior and developing more socially alignedAI systems.


1 Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used incommunication, information curation, and policymaking,highlighting the need to understand not only their accu-racy but also their ethical and philosophical implications[1, 2, 3].
As LLMs become more “human-like,” evalu-ating them solely on correctness is insuﬃcient, especiallyin contexts without clear right or wrong answers.
Whileexplicit biases, such as those related to gender or race, havebeen widely studied [4, 5], more subtle ideological biasesremain a growing concern.
These hidden biases can subtlyinﬂuence public opinion and individual decisions, oftenescaping notice but having signiﬁcant consequences.
Bysystematically identifying and addressing these biases, wecan mitigate risks like misinformation and polarization,ensuring that LLMs foster more informed and balancedpublic discourse.
In this study, we propose a framework for systematicallyevaluating LLMs, focusing on uncovering latent ideologi-cal biases.
Unlike traditional assessments centered on cor-rectness or overt discrimination, our approach examineshow LLMs handle nuanced, subjective, and controversialtopics.
By analyzing responses to questions without a sin-gle “correct” answer, we reveal the ideological stances andadaptability of these models, providing valuable insightsinto their potential societal impacts.
Our framework consists of 436 binary-choice questions(over 43,000 question-answer pairs) derived from taskslikely to be delegated to AI
[6] and diverse “debate topiccollections” in Japanese and English
[7, 8, 9].
We appliedthis framework to two widely used LLMs, ChatGPT 4o-mini and Gemini 1.5 ﬂash, uncovering notable diﬀerencesin their ideological tendencies across both models and lan-guages.
ChatGPT exhibited adaptability, often aligning itsresponses with the questioner’s perspective, while Geminimaintained a more rigid stance.
However, both modelsrevealed problematic biases, with some outputs carryingpotential negative societal consequences.
These subtle biases are particularly concerning becausethey can polarize users, reinforce echo chambers, and per-petuate unvetted narratives.
As LLMs are increasinglyintegrated into high-stakes domains like healthcare, legalsystems, and governance, uncovering their hidden ideo-logical tendencies becomes crucial.
Our study addressesthis by systematically analyzing the ideological foundationsof two prominent LLMs across multiple languages.
Thisanalysis highlights the urgent need for multi-dimensionalevaluation metrics in AI research to ensure ethical andreliable deployment in real-world applications.

Building on these insights, we designed a binary-choiceframework to evaluate LLM behavior in routine and sen-sitive tasks, complemented by debate-style questions forcontroversial topics.
This approach moves beyond surface-level correctness to uncover nuanced biases, aiming toassess LLM suitability and highlight the need for multi-dimensional evaluation metrics for ethical AI deployment.


3 Framework Design

This study introduces a systematic framework for eval-uating biases and tendencies in LLMs through controlledexperiments.
The proposed method is carefully designedto objectively and statistically process a large and diverseset of questions and answers, including those in multiplelanguages.
The basic methodology consists of phase 1(initial) and phase 2 (opposing), and the entire process isshown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.
Some important details ofthe method are as follows:1.
Binary-Choice Questioning: Inputs are 436 binary-choice questions with no deﬁnitive answers.
169questions are related to tasks identiﬁed by Jin [6] ascommonly delegated to AI, and the remaining 267come from Japanese and English “debate topic col-lections”
[7, 8, 9].2.
Prompt Formatting and Iteration (Initial): Inputprompt is ﬁxed format to specify the output for statis-tical analysis.
For 103 questions involving direct com-parisons, these are split into two questions (SplittedQuestions, see Figure 1), increasing the total to 539.Each question is presented randomly in 10 rounds,ensuring independence between them.3.
Answer Quantiﬁcation (Initial): Responses are sta-tistically analyzed by original terms.• Answer Value 𝑎𝑞,𝑟= {−1, 0, 1}.
where 𝑞 isquestion number, 𝑟 is response number.• Bias 𝑏𝑞=110∑10𝑟=1𝑎𝑞,𝑟.•
Willingness 𝑤𝑞= 1
−𝑆2𝑞max𝑞𝑆2𝑞, where 𝑆2𝑞=19∑10𝑟=1(𝑎𝑞,𝑟−𝑏𝑞)2.4.
Prompt Formatting and Iteration (Opposing): Inthe second phase, the input format is modiﬁed to as-sess how LLM responses are inﬂuenced by the ques-tioner’s opposing opinions.
Modiﬁed prompt shownin Figure 2 includes “My opinion is ‘X’.”, where X isthe opposite of LLM’s opinion in the ﬁrst phase.
Theprocess is repeated for 10 rounds to analyze responseshifts.5.
Answer Quantiﬁcation (Opposing): The change (orlack thereof) in the LLM’s responses between thetwo phases provides insights into the strength of itsopinions on various topics.
If the LLM adjusts itsresponse to align with the input opinion, it suggestsweak alignment to the initial bias.
If the LLM main-tains its stance despite the opposing opinion, it indi-cates a strong internal alignment.
Deﬁne Bias Shift𝑠𝑞(equation shown in Figure 2) as how much theopinion (Bias) changed from Initial phase to Oppos-ing, by the aﬀect of questioner’s opinion (‘X’).
Thisdual-phase analysis allows for a nuanced evaluation ofthe LLM’s tendencies, revealing the topics on whichit holds biases or strong opinions.
By systematically quantifying responses and analyzingshifts under contradictory inputs, our framework revealsan LLM’s biases, opinion strength, and distinctive outputcharacteristics.
These insights help identify potential risksand limitations in deploying LLMs for decision-makingand other high-stakes applications.
The entire process ofthe experiment is shown in Figure 2.― 8 ―Example of expected outputsYes.

4 Experiments

To validate the proposed framework, we conducted ex-periments using two of the latest and the most widely usedLLMs in the world, ChatGPT 4o-mini, and Gemini 1.5ﬂash.
Given the need to test a large number of questionsunder independent conditions, the experiments were car-ried out via the OpenAI and Google’s API.
The experimentwas implemented in four languages: Japanese, English,Spanish, and French.
English, Spanish, and French werechosen due to their prominence as the top three languagesin which ChatGPT and Gemini are most commonly used,and Japanese as our home language.


4.1 Results of Overall Statistical Trends

4.1.1 Common Results between ModelsBoth models generally provided consistent answers in allten iterations for many questions.
The Splitted Questionsmethod eﬀectively gauged bias but prior research revealedthat some models are vulnerable to negation [10], requiringcareful application.
In cross-linguistic correlations (Table 3), both Bias-Willingness and Bias Shift showed the highest correlationbetween Spanish and French, while the lowest was betweenSpanish and
Japanese.4.1.2 Unique Results in ChatGPTChatGPT tended to give negative responses with strongexpressions like “always” or “essential” but was more af-ﬁrmative with ambiguous terms like “possible” or “risky.
”Language-speciﬁc tendencies were observed: inJapanese, ChatGPT favored “Yes” answers, including bothquestions of Splitted Questions, resulting in neutral re-sponses (Table 2. )
In contrast, French responses includedmore “Explainers,” an unexpected output explaining moreTable 1 Number of Unexpected Outputs (out of 5390 responseseach)Initial Opposing Initial OpposingNeutral  0 0 0 0Explainers 6 0 0

”When prompted with a speciﬁc opinion, ChatGPT’s re-sponses shifted to align with that opinion, especially innon-Japanese languages, reducing Explainers.4.1.3 Unique Results in GeminiGemini had less diﬀerences in tendencies between lan-guages.
Gemini showed no Explainers or neutral responses(Table 1), providing more deﬁnitive answers in all lan-guages.
It frequently used negations with high Willing-ness, often resulting in Bias and Willingness scores of0,0 for Splitted Questions.
This suggests that when themodel found a question unimportant, it responded nega-tively, showing a lack of bias and commitment.
Gem-inis responses seemed inconsistent with broader societalnorms, suggesting that its behavior might not align withtypical social expectations.


4.2 Results of Detailed Bias in Each Topic

Out of the 436 questions, 315 showed consistent biastendencies in both models, where the average 𝑏𝑞valuesacross languages had the same sign.
Both models tended toselect what we perceived as the “ethically correct” answers― 9 ―Table 3 Correlation Coeﬃcient between LanguagesCorrelation between LanguagesCorrelation Japanese Eng lish Spanish French Correlation Japanese English Spanish FrenchJapanese 1.000 0.636 0.582 0.636 Japanese 1.000 0.753 0.749 0.791English 1.000 0.787 0.813 Eng lish 1.000 0.828 0.835Spanish 1.000 0.836 Spanish 1.000 0.889French 1.000 French 1.000Correlation Japanese Eng lish Spanish French Correlation Japanese English Spanish FrenchJapanese 1.000 0.008 -0.051 -0.030

Representative examples of questions areshown in Table 4 in Appendix.4.2.1 Responses to Sensitive TopicsBoth models exhibited diﬀerences in handling sensitivetopics.
ChatGPT displayed strong neutrality on issues like“Capitalism vs. Socialism,” “Abortion,” and “Existenceof God,” avoiding deﬁnitive opinions to maintain neutral-ity, which could be seen as an eﬀort to safeguard ethicalstandards.
In contrast, Gemini responded negatively to sensitivetopics, including Splitted Questions where neutrality ispreferred, clearly rejecting both sides.
For religious topics, ChatGPT remained neutral, whileGemini consistently negated them, raising potential con-cerns about bias.
This suggests that while Gemini’s ap-proach may act as an ethical safeguard, it could also reﬂectan inherent bias when applied consistently.4.2.2
Problematic BiasesThe experimental results revealed several problematicbiases that could lead to various adverse eﬀects.
Herein,we present some representative examples.• Money on the Street: When asked about what to doif a small amount of money was found on the street,ChatGPT almost always suggested “reporting it to thepolice.”
In contrast, Gemini fully supported the ideaof “keeping it” in both English and Spanish (Q361).• Happiness of Marriage and Religion: In a compari-son of happiness based on marital status and religiousbeliefs, Gemini adopted a completely neutral stance,while ChatGPT leaned toward the idea that marriedpeople and those who practice religion are happier(Q403, 405).• Gender and Happiness: When comparing the happi-ness of men and women, Gemini remained completelyneutral, whereas ChatGPT asserted that women arehappier (Q459, 461).• Religion: Regarding questions about the existence ofGod and the afterlife, ChatGPT maintained a strongneutral position, while Gemini denied both (Q487,488).• Brand Comparisons: In a comparison of platformssuch as Instagram vs. Twitter and YouTube vs.TikTok, Gemini remained completely neutral, whileChatGPT showed a preference for Instagram andYouTube (Q504, 506).


5 Limitations

While the 436 questions proposed in this study serve as aframework for evaluating biases in LLMs, it does not coverall possible topics potential bias that may exist.
Furthermore, this research focused on examining dif-ferences in model behavior across languages.
However,it remains unclear whether the observed discrepancies aretruly the result of linguistic diﬀerences in how the LLMprocesses information, or if they are a consequence of un-intended shifts in meaning that occurred during the trans-lation of prompts.


6 Conclusion

Through our proposed experimental methodology, thisstudy demonstrated that both ChatGPT and Gemini exhibitbiases across diverse topics, with variations observed notonly between the models but also across languages andinputs.
ChatGPT tends to align its responses with thequestioner’s perspective, while Gemini maintains a morerigid stance.
On sensitive topics, ChatGPT occasionallyadopts a neutral position, whereas Gemini often respondsﬁrmly, sometimes leaning toward negative interpretations.
These ﬁndings suggest that both models could subtly in-ﬂuence decision-making in real-world tasks, particularlythose likely delegated to AI, as highlighted by Jin
[6].Our methodology oﬀers a robust framework for evalu-ating LLM biases and ideological tendencies, moving be-yond sur face-level biases to uncover implicit patterns inreal-world contexts.
Using a two-phase approach, it as-sesses how LLMs align with user perspectives, oﬀeringinsights into their “human-like” adaptability.
Addition-ally, its adaptability across languages supports large-scalestatistical analysis, enhancing its relevance for evaluatingvarious models in diverse linguistic and cultural settings.― 10 ―
