Abstract 

This paper introduces a novel system for the automatic identification of argument structures in German sentenc-es.
Our approach addresses the complexities of German syntax, including flexible word order, rich morphological inflection, and diverse clause types.
We leverage spaCy’s German language models, which provide com-prehensive pipelines for tagging, morphological analysis, parsing, and lemmatization.
By combining the  model outputs with linguistic rules, we have  implemented a rule-based approach for argument structure identifica-tion.
To evaluate our system, we created a gold-standard dataset through a systematic annotation process in which annotators validated  and refined initial parser outputs.
Beyond argument extraction, our parser identifies the main verb of each (sub-)clause, classifies the genus verbi (active/passive), and determines clause types (e.g., main clauses, various subordinate clauses).
This work lays a foundation for large-scale corpus-based investigations of argument structures in German, enabling more compre-hensive linguistic analyses.  

1 Introduction 

Argument structure parsing remains an open challenge in computational linguistics, particularly for morpholog-ically rich languages like German [1].
Although parsers for part-of-speech tagging, morphological, syntactic, and dependency structures exist [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], there is no system specifically for parsing argument structures.
This gap arises from the complexity of German syntax, marked by flexible word order, diverse clause types (e.g., main clauses, relative clauses, complement clauses), and complex verbal morphology.
These morphosyntactic features pose significant chal-lenges for argument structure parsing.
The variability in argument placement and the interaction of morphological markers complicate the direct application of syntactic parsing methods.
Additionally, distinguishing between active and passive constructions (Genus Verbi) and ac-curately identifying argument roles requires more in-depth  analysis than standard dependency parsing can provide.  


1.1 Research Gap and Approach 

Current German parsing tools focus on phrase struc-ture or dependency analysis but do not provide a com-prehensive argument structure representation.
To fill this gap, we propose a novel system that builds on existing syntactic parsers while applying linguistically informed rules to detect and classify argument roles.
This integra-tion enables a more detailed representation that includes clause segmentation, argument labeling, and genus verbi classification.  


1.2  Contributions and Paper Organiza-

This work offers two main contributions: (1) A comprehensive annotation scheme for German argument structures and clause types (2) An integrated parser that combines spaCy’s German language models with morphological cues and custom rules The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a theoretical foundation, explaining the concept of argu-ment structures, their relevance in German linguistics, and the challenges involved in their computational iden-tification.
Section 3 outlines our annotation guidelines, tagsets, and data preparation process.
Section 4 details our parser methodology and integration process.
Section 5 presents our evaluation plan and preliminary  results.
Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and outlines  di-rections for future research  

2 Theoretical Background 

Argument structures are syntactic patterns that co-occur with verbs.
In English, for example, the fol-lowing sentences are instantiations of the argument structures in the blanket:  (1) a. Tom sneezed the handkerchief off the table.
[NP1 V NP2 directional PP] b.
Jessie gave him an answer.
[NP1 V NP2 NP3] 

 


In Cognitive Construction Grammar
[7, 8, 9], which is our theoretical framework, the assumption is  that argu-ment structures have their own meanings and are there-fore "constructions", which are regarded as pairs of form and meaning.
Sentences are supposed to be produced by the semantic fusion of argument structure constructions and verbs.
When attempting to linguistically analyze German argument structure constructions on a large scale, the first major task is to identify the argument structure constructions of each sentence in the corpus data in order to see empirically which verbs are possible in a given argument structure construction [10].
Fur-thermore, the identified database of argument structure constructions is applicable to the empirical analysis of the valency of German verbs [see 11].  


2.1 Argument Structure in German 

As a morphologically rich language, German distin-guishes four cases nominative,  accusative,  dative  and genitive, which are mainly coded by article declination.
Thus, in contrast to English, the form of argument struc-ture constructions must include case information:  (2) a.  
Tom nieste das Taschentuch vom Tisch.
[NPnom V NPacc directional PPdat] b. Jessy gab ihm eine Antwort.
[NPnom V NPdat NPacc]  
Syntactically, German has three main types of verb location which are combined with their functions: (3) a. Kommt Hans heute?
(Does Hans come today?)
[verb-first, interrogative] b.  
Hans  kommt  heute.
(Hans will come today.)
[verb-second, declarative] c. Ich weiß, dass Hans heute kommt.
(I know that Hans will come today.)[verb-final, subordina-tion]  
In verb-second sentences, one syntactic element can be topicalized freely in the pre-verbal position:  (4) a.
Das Taschentuch nieste Tom vom Tisch.
b.
Ihm gab Jessie eine Antwort. 

 


The identification of argument structures in German is more challenging because of morphological and syntac-tic variability.
Other syntactically modifying possibilities include  scrambling  with respect to the variability of midfield position and dislocation  with respect to the placement of an element at the end of a sentence.  


2.2 Computational Parsing of Argument 



Structures 

To date, there are no dedicated parsers for extracting argument structures in German.
[1] While tools for de-pendency and phrase structure parsing exist
[4, 6], they serve different linguistic purposes and are not designed to identify argument structures explicitly.
Parsing argument structures depends on multiple lin-guistic factors, including syntactic relations such as sub-jects and objects, morphological features like case marking, and dependency relations.
Many of these fea-tures can be recognized by existing parsers, but a key challenge  lies in combining this information into a co-herent argument structure representation.
Our work ad-dresses this challenge by integrating these linguistic cues into a unified parsing approach, laying the foundation for more advanced research in German argument parsing.  


3 Data and Resource Preparation 

To develop a robust parser for German argument structures, we required a carefully annotated dataset that reflects  linguistic diversity and syntactic complexity.
This section outlines the creation of our gold-standard dataset, covering both the annotation process and the corpus selection criteria．  

3.1 Annotation Guidelines and Tagsets 

To create a consistent, linguistically meaningful gold-standard dataset, we developed a comprehensive annotation schema.
This schema defines key linguistic layers relevant to German argument structure parsing: Clause Type: Categorization of clauses based on syntactic roles, such as main clauses (Hauptsätze) and various subordinate clauses (e.g., Komplementsätze, Relativsätze).
Genus Verbi:  Identification of clause voice as either active (Aktiv) or passive (Passiv).
Verb Identification:  Annotation of the main verb of each (sub-)clause, including its correct lemma.
Argument Structure:  Labeling of arguments (e.g., nominal phrases, prepositional phrases) of an argu-ment-taking lexical item, typically the verb, based on grammatical roles and morphological features.
We designed precise tagsets for each layer, ensuring detailed and consistent annotations.
The full list of tags is included in the appendix.
Annotators were trained to follow standardized annotation guidelines, specifying how each linguistic feature should be identified, correct-ed, and documented.
By adhering to this structured annotation process, we established a high-quality gold-standard dataset that serves both as a benchmark for evaluation and as a re-source for future research on German argument structure parsing.  


3.2 Corpus 

To create a varied dataset for German argument struc-ture parsing, we selected texts from four major genres, following the text classification schemes used by the DWDS (Digitales Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache) and DTA (Deutsches Textarchiv): Academic Texts, Literary Fiction, Newspaper Articles, Non-Fiction Prac-tical Texts (specifically horoscopes).
Each text contains approximately 10,000 characters, ensuring comparable text lengths across genres.
This selection  is intended to capture  a range of linguistic styles, registers, and syntactic complexities, providing a diverse basis for parser evaluation and the creation of a gold-standard dataset.  


4 Parser Architecture 

Our system builds on spaCy’s German language mod-els, leveraging dependency parses, POS tags, and mor-phological features to analyze syntactic structures and extract argument structures.
The parser processes text by examining dependency labels and constructing a syntac-tic tree rooted in each verb.
This enables the identifica-tion of clause boundaries and classification of clause types (e.g., main or subordinate clauses) based on syn-tactic cues such as conjunctions, dependency relations, and morphological features.
Starting from each identified verb, the parser explores its syntactic subtree to detect arguments, using case marking, POS tags, and dependency labels.
Argument roles such as subjects, objects, and prepositional phrases are determined based on their syntactic and morphologi-cal properties.
The parser additionally handles  complex constructions like reflexive pronouns, verbal particles, and infinitival clauses by applying linguistically in-formed rules.
The extracted arguments are mapped back to corre-sponding text segments, ensuring that each argument is accurately positioned within its clause.
This layered, rule-based approach allows for  a comprehensive repre-sentation of argument structures, enabling detailed syn-tactic and morphological analysis of German sentences.  


5 Evaluation 

The evaluation of our parser focuses primarily on the recognition of argument structures, assessing how accu-rately syntactic arguments such as nominal and preposi-tional phrases are identified and labeled.
We compared the parser’s outputs against the gold-standard dataset and evaluated performance using standard metrics: Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1-Score.
In Table 1, we  summarize  the performance in argu-ment structure recognition across the different text types, reporting precision, recall, and F1-Scores.
As shown, spaCy’s  transformer-based  German  model (de_trf) con-sistently achieves higher F1-Scores compared to the conventional (de_lg) approach, indicating superior han-dling of complex syntactic and morphological cues.
The parser also demonstrates strong recall values, suggesting that it successfully captures the majority of relevant arguments, although some trade-off with precision re-mains in more varied or creative text genres.  
Table 1  Argument Structure Identification: Pre-cision, Recall, and F1-Scores model de_trf  de_lg Pre.  
Rec.  F1  Pre.  Rec.  F1 all  0.84  0.95  0.89  0.68  0.79  0.73 newspaper  0.89  0.96  0.92  0.71  0.76  0.74 fiction  0.73  0.94  0.82  0.62  0.83  0.71

0.84  0.61  0.74  0.67  
In addition to argument structure extraction, we evalu-ated three complementary tasks relevant to German ar-gument parsing: lexical head (main verb) identification, genus verbi classification (active vs. passive) and clause type recognition (e.g., main or subordinate clause).
These results are presented in Table 2, where each task is measured in terms of accuracy.
While the transform-er-based model (de_trf) again outperforms the conven-tional model (de_lg) in most cases, the gap is somewhat narrower for genus verbi identification, especially in standardized newspaper texts.
Clause type classification proved to be the most challenging overall, reflecting the complexity of German sentence structures - particularly in fictional and academic writing.

0.84  0.61  0.74  0.67  
The  results indicate that our integrated approach, which combines syntactic parsing with morphological and dependency cues, yields robust performance across domains.
However, there remains room for improvement, especially in clause segmentation and classification, where expanded rule sets and  additional training data may further enhance accuracy.  


6 Conclusion and Future Work 

As indicated in Tables 1 and 2, initial results show that our parser is particularly effective at identifying argu-ments in non-fiction and newspaper texts, with solid precision and recall values.
Lexical head identification and genus verbi classification also achieve promising accuracy, although clause type recognition still poses challenges in more syntactically complex domains.
While the parser establishes a strong baseline, a few areas remain for improvement.
One key limitation is the lack of semantic information: integrating semantic roles and argument-specific properties could significantly enhance parsing accuracy.  
For example, distinguishing between transitive and intransitive verbs (often found in lexical resources) could help refine argument identifica-tion rules.
Additionally, our rule-based approach requires further validation of individual rules to assess their reliability and overall contribution.  
Expanding the system with more comprehensive linguistic rules or hybrid approach-es that incorporate machine learning models could fur-ther enhance performance.
Looking ahead, the parser’s results could serve as a foundation for creating large-scale datasets used to train transformer-based models specifically designed for ar-gument structure recognition, opening new research perspectives in German linguistics.
