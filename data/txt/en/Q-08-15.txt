Abstract

Recent advancements in Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)have uncovered insightful features in large language models(LLMs).
In this study, we identify language-speciÔ¨Åc SAEfeatures, which are predominantly found in the later layersof the LLM.
Using these features, we steer the output lan-guage of an LLM.
In an experiment based on a translationtask, our method achieves a 49% accuracy in generating thedesired target language, outperforming a previous methodusing individual language neurons for steering.
This workdemonstrates the potential for SAE features for languagesteering.


1 Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) process information ina complex and compressed manner, making it diÔ¨Écult forhumans to understand.
This challenge extends to the Ô¨Åeldof multilinguality, where multilinguality in LLMs is cur-rently being studied.
Recent research has shown the ex-istence of language neurons that can be used to steer theoutput language [1].
In parallel, recent progress in mech-anistic interpretability includes the development of SparseAutoencoders (SAEs)[2, 3], which help to break down thehidden activations of an LLM into simpler and more in-terpretable components, called features.
In this work, webuild on these advances and show that there are language-speciÔ¨Åc SAE features.
We then use these features to steeran LLM‚Äôs output language.


2 Related work

This work builds on advances in research into multilin-guality in LLMs, activation steering, and SAEs.
Severalrecent studies have researched multilinguality in LLMs,providing insights into how these models handle multiplelanguages.
Muller et al.
[4] demonstrated that the mul-tilingual capabilities of LLMs are primarily concentratedin the Ô¨Årst and last layers, with a language-agnostic spaceoccupying the middle layers.
Wendler et al.
[5] found thatthe representations in the middle layers lie close to English.
In the area of activation steering, Suau et al.
[6] intro-duced a method to identify individual neurons associatedwith speciÔ¨Åc concepts and demonstrated how these neu-rons can be used to steer model outputs.
Building on this,Kojima et al.
[1] applied the concept of activation steeringto multilinguality, identifying language neurons and usingthem to steer a model‚Äôs output language.
A key challenge in using individual neurons for steeringis the problem of ‚Äúpolysemanticity‚Äù [7] and ‚Äúsuperposi-tion‚Äù
[8], where a single neuron can represent multipleunrelated concepts simultaneously.
This complicates pre-cise control over the model‚Äôs behavior, as modifying oneneuron might unintentionally aÔ¨Äect other unrelated fea-tures.
In contrast, SAE features decompose the internalactivations into more interpretable components, therebypotentially reducing the risk of unintentionally activatingunrelated features.
SpeciÔ¨Åcally, an SAE is a weak dictio-nary learning method applied to the internal activations ofa model, which allows us to decompose the residual streaminto largely human-understandable features [2, 3].
Thesefeatures can be used to steer a model output, as demon-strated and further improved by Chalnev et al.
[9].In this work, we use SAE features to investigate a newapproach to language steering, combining insights frommultilinguality, activation steering, and mechanistic inter-pretability.

Our method

Our steering method is fairly straightforward.
First, weÔ¨Ånd language-speciÔ¨Åc features in an SAE trained on theresidual stream of a layer of the target model.
Next, we usethese features to steer the model‚Äôs output language.


3.1 Finding language-speciÔ¨Åc features

In our Ô¨Årst step, we Ô¨Ånd language-speciÔ¨Åc features ina series of pre-trained SAEs.
We employ the followingtwo individual approaches to identify language-speciÔ¨Åcfeatures.
Language classiÔ¨Åer approach We begin by observ-ing all features of a given SAE.
To determine language-speciÔ¨Åc features, we examine the contexts in which a fea-ture has its highest activations.
We then use a languageclassiÔ¨Åer to classify the language of each context.
If aplurality of the contexts belongs to a speciÔ¨Åc language, weclassify the feature as a language-speciÔ¨Åc feature for thatlanguage.
Feature description approach To identifylanguage-speciÔ¨Åc features based on their feature de-scription, we use Neuronpedia1Ôºâ.
Neuronpedia providesautointerpretability explanations generated by an LLM.This autointerpretability explanation is generated byshowing a feature‚Äôs top activating contexts to an LLMand letting the LLM generate a likely explanation forthe feature‚Äôs role in the model.
By searching theseexplanations for the names of the steering languages, weare able to Ô¨Ånd language-speciÔ¨Åc features.


3.2 Steering model output

Numerous methods have been proposed to control thebehavior of LLMs through steering by intervening in theirinternal activations [10, 11, 12, 13].
In this study, we optfor the most common approach, which involves adding asteering vector to the activations [14].
In this method, thedecoder weights from a sparse autoencoder are extractedat the index corresponding to the desired language-speciÔ¨Åc1Ôºâ https://www.neuronpedia.org/feature for constructing the steering vector.
During theforward pass, the steering vector is added to the residualstream, mathematically represented as:resid‚Ä≤= resid + ùõº ¬∑ steering vector,where ùõº is a scaling factor that adjusts the intensity of thesteering, and resid refers to the residual stream, which is thesum of the outputs of all previous layers in the model.
Thisscaling factor allows the model‚Äôs output to be Ô¨Åne-tunedto align with the target language.
Notably, this minimallyinvasive approach hooks into the residual stream withoutmodifying the model‚Äôs architecture.


4 Experiments



4.1 Finding language-speciÔ¨Åc features

Training an SAE requires substantial LLM activationdata.
For example, the Gemmascope project2Ôºâsaved 20Pebibytes of activation data while training their SAEs [15].To avoid handling such large volumes of data, we used thepre-trained SAEs from the Gemmascope project.
Specif-ically, we based our research on SAEs trained on Gemma2 2B3Ôºâ.
These SAEs are trained on the residual streamsof each of the 26 layers of the model, resulting in 26 in-dividual SAEs.
Each SAE is conÔ¨Ågured with a hiddenlayer width of 214.
For our feature description approach,we also searched SAEs with a width of 216.
The SAEscome with a list of contexts for each feature‚Äôs highest acti-vations.
Using the langid classiÔ¨Åer
[16], we classiÔ¨Åed thelanguage of these contexts.
To cover an array of languagesfrom diÔ¨Äerent language families, we focused on language-speciÔ¨Åc features from German, French, Spanish, Chinese,and Japanese.
By using the language classiÔ¨Åer approachexplained in Section 3.1, we found the language-speciÔ¨Åcfeatures shown in Figure 1.
@NOTE: include smth like:Ô¨Ånally, bc other had too many features, we used manualThe language classiÔ¨Åer approach yielded many features,so we used our feature description approach explained inSection 3.1 to Ô¨Ånd individual features to use in our steer-ing experiment.
We found the language-speciÔ¨Åc featuresshown in Table 3 (in Appendix) to be eÔ¨Äective in steering.
We did not identify English language features, a limita-tion that we further discuss in Section 5.2Ôºâ https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/gemma scope3Ôºâ https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2-2b0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25Layer Number0100200300400500600Number of FeaturesNon-English Features per LayerFigure 1 Amount of language-speciÔ¨Åc features per layer foundby the language classiÔ¨Åer approach.


4.2 Steering model output

Experimental design For our steering experiments,we followed a setup similar to that of Kojima et al.
[ 1].We conducted two types of experiments: unconditionalgeneration and conditional generation.
For each experi-ment, we generated 100 samples.
For unconditional gen-eration, we used a simple ‚Äú<bos>‚Äù token (beginning-of-sequence token) as the prompt to initiate text generation.
For conditional generation, we employed the FLORES-200dataset
[17] to create a controlled translation task.
In thistask, we used a prompt of the following format:Translate an English sentence into a targetlanguage.
English: {source text}.
TargetLanguage:
In both experiments, we applied the language-speciÔ¨Åc fea-tures described in Table 3 (in Appendix) for steering.
To evaluate the eÔ¨Äectiveness of our method, we mea-sured two aspects: the accuracy of producing the desiredtarget language and the quality of the translations per-formed by the model.
In the unconditional generationtask, we only measured the accuracy, while in the condi-tional generation task, we calculated both accuracy and theBLEU score.
To calculate the accuracy, we classiÔ¨Åed thelanguage of the generated text using the language identiÔ¨Å-cation classiÔ¨Åer FastText
[18].
Mirroring Kojima et al.
[1],we used a classiÔ¨Åcation score threshold of 0.5 and calcu-lated the ratio of the target language occurrence, leavingus with an accuracy value.
For the BLEU score in theconditional generation task, we calculated it between eachgenerated text and the corresponding ground-truth text.
Toensure comparability with Kojima et al.
[1], we mirroredthe settings used in his study.
To Ô¨Ånd the optimal steering strength for each feature, weTable 1 Comparison of unconditional and conditional genera-tion results.

Steering results Table 1 shows the results for uncon-ditional and conditional generation after we selected theoptimal steering strength for each language.
A positive correlation was observed between steeringstrength and accuracy across all tasks, with a strongersteering strength resulting in model outputs that were moreclosely aligned with the intended language.
Increasing thesteering strength increased the accuracy until reaching aplateau, after which the accuracy did not improve further,as seen in Figure 2 (in Appendix).Table 2 shows some text generation examples.
Lowcoherence is noticeable.


5 Discussion

Comparison with Kojima et al.
Table 4 (in Ap-pendix) shows a comparison between our language steeringmethod based on SAE features, and the language neuron-based method introduced by Kojima et al.
[1].
For a cor-rect comparison, we implemented Kojima et al.‚Äôs steer-ing method on the Gemma 2 2B model.
In terms of ac-curacy, our approach outperformed the language neuron-based method across most languages.
However, both meth-ods struggled to output coherent text, as seen in the verylow BLEU scores in Table 4 (in Appendix), as well asin our example generations in Table 2.
Other generationsshowed even lower coherence than the ones presented inthis chart.
In contrast to the low BLEU scores of bothour and Kojima et al.‚Äôs method for steering on Gemma2 2B, in Kojima et al.‚Äôs work, higher BLEU scores wereachieved using a larger model, Llama 7B. However, sincewe used the comparatively small Gemma 2 2B, coherentoutput was not achieved by either method, and thus weTable 2 Generation Text ExamplesLanguage Conditional Generation Unconditional Generationde Enceladus ist im die von der unzenartigenobj auf.

Absence of English language steering A notablelimitation of our approach is the absence of identiÔ¨Åedlanguage-speciÔ¨Åc features for English.
This is due to thefact that except for our language-speciÔ¨Åc features, nearlyall features activate on English tokens, making it diÔ¨Écultto isolate distinct English-only features.
Future researchcould focus on Ô¨Ånding English-only features by checkingif a given feature activates only on English input and noother input.
Steering strength vs. output quality Kojima etal.
[1] discussed a trade-oÔ¨Ä between the number of lan-guage neurons used for steering and the quality of thegeneration, as measured by the BLEU score.
In our ex-perimental setup, it is likely that the strength of steeringinÔ¨Çuenced the quality of t he generated output.
We veriÔ¨Åedthis manually by checking the coherence of the generatedtext.
However, due to the low quality of the generatedoutput, we could not investigate this relationship compre-hensively.
Coherence of the generated output It is notewor-thy that our SAE steering method failed to produce coher-ent output, as seen in the low BLEU scores and generationexamples.
We speculate that there are multiple reasonsfor this.
First, we measured the performance of steeringon the comparatively small Gemma 2 2B.
We speculatethat our method would produce more coherent output inlarger models, as the same trend can be seen in Kojima etal.
[1].
Second, although Gemma 2 2B can generate co-herent text when steered with other features, these featuresare typically English.
This suggests that the model‚Äôs lim-ited size and its predominantly English training data limitits steering success.
Third, SAE features may inÔ¨Çuencethe model‚Äôs behavior in unintended ways, as explored byChalnev et al.
[9].To address these challenges, we propose several potentialimprovements to our approach.
The most critical improve-ment is a better feature selection.
Future research should fo-cus on reÔ¨Åning the method of identifying language-speciÔ¨Åcfeatures.
For instance, instead of classifying the languageof the entire context‚Äï much of which may not actuallyactivate the feature‚Äï a higher weight could be given tothe tokens in the context that actually lead to an activationof the feature.
Also, to further investigate the reason forthe inability to produce coherent output, investigating thelanguage features with the method introduced by Chalnevet al.
[9] could prove fruitful.
Apart from an improved fea-ture selection, improvements in the steering methods canalso be explored.
For example, instead of single features,an average of multiple features could be used.


6 Conclusion

This study has demonstrated that language-speciÔ¨Åc SAEfeatures exist.
Although our method based on languagefeatures cannot generate coherent text, its accuracy is com-parable or superior to the method proposed by Kojima et al.
As highlighted in Section 5, there remain opportunities forimprovement.
We hope that this study will lead to furtherresearch into language-speciÔ¨Åc SAE features.
Understand-ing these language-speciÔ¨Åc features better will allow us tofurther uncover how multilinguality in LLMs works.
