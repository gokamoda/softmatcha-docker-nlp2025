Abstract

This study proposes a zero pronoun annotation schemethat is easy to adopt cross-linguistically, regardless of lan-guage types, due to its reliance only on raw corpus data andthe absence of prerequisites such as constituency trees orpredicate-argument structures.
A spoken language Malaycorpus has been annotated using it.
The results are com-pared to the distribution of zero pronouns in a Japanesecorpus, namely the NAIST Text Corpus.


1 Introduction

1）Many languages in the world allow arguments that can oth-erwise be expressed overtly with pronouns or full nounphrases to be “omitted.”
This phenomenon is knownas “pro drop.
”2）For example, the Malay example in (1)contains three instances of pro drop indicated by 𝑒 (for“empty”), which we refer to as “zero pronoun.
”3）(1) Bilawhen𝑒1jumpasee𝑒2, diashecakapsay𝑒3dahalreadypenat.4）tired‘When I1saw her2, she said she3was already tired.
’According to Grambank (Feature GB522)[4, 5], 1,135out of the 1,535 languages with the relevant data point(73.9%) allow subject pro drop.
English is not a prodrop language and belongs to the minority.
At least fourtypes of pro drop languages have been identiﬁed: (i) lan-guages with rich agreement (consistent/agreement-basedpro drop; e.g. Italian), (ii) languages without agreement1）
A considerable part of this study is based on the second author’sMaster’s thesis [1].2） NLP practitioners should be more familiar with the related term“zero anaphora (resolution),” which is a kind of anaphora (resolution)that involves zero pronouns resulted from pro drop.3） Other terms for 𝑒 include “pro,” “null argument/pronoun” and“empty category/pronoun.

This sentencewas taken from the ZSM MXD2012 subcorpus of the LeipzigCorpora Collection [2] using MALINDO Conc
[3].(radical/discourse-based pro drop; e.g. Japanese), (iii) lan-guages with agreement and referential null subjects whosedistribution is restricted (partial pro drop; e.g. Finnish) and(iv) languages with only impersonal and quasi-argumentalnull subjects (semi pro drop; e.g. Icelandic)[6].
Pro droplanguages diﬀer with regard to where 𝑒 occurs and how 𝑒 isinterpreted.
They also diﬀer in the conditions under which𝑒 is chosen over its overt alternative.
Corpora annotated with zero pronouns are essential forinvestigating the linguistic properties of pro drop and solv-ing NLP tasks involving pro drop languages such as zeroanaphora resolution, machine translation and informationextraction.
However, as discussed in §2, such resources areavailable in only a handful of languages, despite the largenumber of pro drop languages.
Moreover, there does notseem to exist a common scheme for zero pronoun anno-tation that can be utilized cross-linguistically.
Therefore,this study proposes one such scheme (§3) and annotates aMalay corpus using it (§4).
The annotation ﬁles are openlyavailable at https://github.com/matbahasa/Melayu_Standard_Lisan/tree/master/NorHashimah/.

2 Existing methods of zero pronoun



annotation

According to our survey, at least the following ten lan-guages have publicly available corpora annotated with zeropronouns: Arabic, Catalan, Chinese, German, Indonesian,Japanese, Korean, Malay, Portuguese and Spanish.
Table1 summarizes the corpora
we could ﬁnd.
Most of them de-pend on constituency trees.
We regard it as a good featurebecause linguistic studies have shown that the position of 𝑒in the constituent tree and the grammatical function it de-termines are important.
However, building a constituencytreebank requires considerable eﬀort, and hence presup-posing it for the purpose of zero pronoun annotation ispractically unrealistic for most languages.
The ZAC cor-pus in Portuguese alters the corpus by inserting a tag inTable 1 Existing corpora with zero pronoun annotationCorpus Language Dependency Alter Position Function ReferenceOntoNotes

This method may be the easiest for ordi-nary linguists, for whom installing annotation tools such asdoccano
[ 7] is almost impossible.
However, it is generallygood to keep the raw corpus data separate from its annota-tions.
The grammatical function value for the NAIST TextCorpus in Japanese is in parentheses because it employsmorphological cases rather than grammatical functions.
Morphological cases are a good indicator of grammaticalfunctions, but the mapping is not perfect.
Thus, althoughnominative case-marked noun phrases are usually subjects,they can also be objects.
Moreover, many languages simplydo not have morphological case.


3 Common scheme for zero pro-



noun annotation

We propose a common scheme for zero pronoun annotationthat (i) does not presuppose another annotation, (ii) doesnot alter the corpus itself and (iii) can be used in anylanguage.
Bila jumpa , dia cakap dah penat.1st_S 3rd_DO 3rd_Sharga boleh berunding.3rd_P1st_S2Figure
1 Sample sentences with zero pronoun annotations

3.1 Tagset

The proposed tagset consists of two categories: person andgrammatical function.
These two categories are frequentlyreferred to in linguistic studies on pro drop.
Table 2 sum-marizes the tags belonging to each category with examplesin English, where the relevant items are indicated by bold-face.
These tags have 12 (= 3 × 4) possible combinations,which we will represent by joining the two categories withan underscore as in 1st_S.

3.2 What to annotate

Since zero pronouns, by deﬁnition, do not appear in anyform in the text, the token immediately after the positionwhere e occurs is the target of the annotation.5）The nexttoken includes punctuation marks.
Figure 1 shows howsentences (1) and (3) are annotated.
One may wonder if it would be more intuitive to anno-tate white spaces.
However, such a method is invalid forlanguages that do not use white spaces such as Chinese andJapanese.
A special treatment is required in languages thatlack punctuation marks to indicate a sentence boundary.
Lao and Thai are the only such languages that we know,5）
This makes it possible to formulate zero pronoun detection as abinary tagging problem (token preceded by 𝑒 vs. token not precededby 𝑒), as suggested by [18].but there is a recent trend of not ending a sentence with afull stop or its equivalent in casual writing even in otherlanguages such as English and Japanese.
In such cases,when 𝑒 occurs sentence-ﬁnally, the token before it can beannotated using a special symbol, such as 3rd_DO*, where* indicates that 𝑒 occurs after the annotated token.
The position of 𝑒 is determined based on the canonicalword order.
This rule is most relevant in languages whoseword order is ﬂexible such as Japanese and Ukrainian.
Forexample, the canonical word order in Japanese is “S IO DOV” although other orders are also possible.
The Japanesesentence in (2) illustrates this point.(2) 𝑒1(S)𝑒2(IO)Kanshokukaadocompletion.cardoacco-watasi-itasimasupol-give-polnode,because𝑒3(S)reziregisterniteat𝑒4(DO)go-teizi-kudasai.6）pol-present-request‘We1will give you2a completion card, and you3arekindly requested to present it4at the register.’


4 Annotation of a Malay corpus



4.1 Methodology

Corpus We use the conversation data provided as ap-pendices by [20, 21].
It consists of 4,518 sentences com-prising 34,724 tokens.
This data has been digitalized andmade openly available as a part of Korpus Variasi BahasaMelayu (Corpus of Malay Varieties).7）The conversationsin [20] take place at markets and involve sellers and shop-pers whilst those in [21] consist of two kinds, one beingconversations dur ing cooking events and the other beinginterviews about the use of person referring expressions.
Although both contain elements presented as regional di-alects, the entire data has been normalized, that is, con-verted to word forms of the standard variety.
Hence, thecorpus can be considered one of Standard Malay with oc-casional mixing of dialectal words.
Annotators and annotation tool
The annotationwas done by the second author and checked by the third6）
This sentence is due to [ 19], who found it in an announcementabout a food waste prevention campaign at an Otoya restaurant inMarch 2021.
[19] posits 𝑒2in a diﬀerent position, which we revisein this paper.7） https://github.com/matbahasa/Melayu_Standard_Lisanauthor using doccano [7].
Since it does not support layers,we cannot separate the two annotation categories.
We thusdecided to create 12 tags by combining a person tag and agrammatical function tag (1st_S, 1st_DO, 1st_IO, . . . ).


4.2 Language speciﬁc considerations

The actual annotation task requires various language spe-ciﬁc considerations.
Here we only note three of them thatwe think can aﬀect the annotation results.
Others are pre-sented in Appendix A.Secondary annotation tags The possessor followsthe possessed noun it modiﬁes in Malay.
This word orderand other Malay-speciﬁc phenomena can bring about asituation in which two zero pronouns occur in a row.
Anexample is given in (3).
𝑒1is
the possessor and part of thetopic noun phrase whilst 𝑒2is
the subject.(3) hargaprice𝑒1𝑒2bolehcanberunding.negotiate‘(regarding) its1price, we2can negotiate.
’According to the common scheme proposed in §3 above,boleh will receive two tags, namely 3rd_P and 1st_S. Theproblem of simply assigning two tags is that the relativeorder information between the two is lost.
To circumventthis problem, we introduced secondary tags with the suﬃx“2” to indicate a given tag follows the other unmarked tag.
In this case, 𝑒2is represented as 1st_S2 (see Figure 1).Dative alternation Malay has dative alternation be-tween “S V DO kepada ‘to’/untuk ‘for’ IO” (optional prepo-sition phrase) and “S V IO DO” (double object construc-tion).
Hence, when IO is not overtly expressed, the sen-tence can be parsed as either pattern in principle.
In suchsentences, we chose the latter double object constructionanalysis.
Thus, (4a) is parsed as (4b), which contains azero indirect object.(4) a. Kakelder.sisterbagigivehargapriceniagatradedahalreadyni.this‘I’ve already given (you) the trade price.’b.
Kak bagi 𝑒 harga niaga dah ni.
Bare deﬁnites vs. possessive deﬁnites Malay doesnot have a deﬁnite article like English the.
Deﬁnite nounphrases can either be bare (bare deﬁnites) or involve adeterminer such as a possessor (possessive deﬁnites) ora demonstrative.
Consequently, some bare noun phrasescan be parsed as either a bare deﬁnite or a possessiveTable 3 Breakdown according to personPerson 1st 2nd

In such cases,we chose the latter possessive deﬁnite analysis becausepossessive deﬁnites are not uncommon in Malay.8）This iswhy we analysed (3) as involving a zero pronoun denotingthe possessor (𝑒1) rather than analyze ayah ‘father’ as barewithout any sort of omission.


4.3 Results

The total number of annotations made to the corpus is4,469.
Tables 3 and 4 show their breakdowns according toperson and grammatical function, respectively.
In terms ofperson, while third person is more frequent than ﬁrst andsecond person, no striking diﬀerence exists between thelatter two.
As for grammatical function, about two thirdsof zero pronouns in the corpus are subjects.
Indirect objectsturned out to be more prone to be zero than direct objects.
It must be noted, however, that this result is partly due toour decision concerning dative alternation to choose thedouble object construction analysis (cf. §4.2), which willnaturally increase the number of IOs.
Figure 2 shows the distribution of the combinations ofperson and grammatical function.
The following two ob-servations can be made.
First, subject is most often realizedas zero, regardless of person.
Second, the other grammati-cal functions are realized as zero more often in third personthan ﬁrst and second person.


4.4 Comparison with Japanese

In this section, we compare the results above with Japanese,speciﬁcally the NAIST Text Corpus.
Although it consistsof formal writings unlike our corpus, [14] provide detailedstatistics that enable an easy comparison.
As noted in §2,8）
A similar zero pronoun annotation task should choose the baredeﬁnite analysis in languages in which possessive deﬁnites are notso common such as Japanese.3rd_S1st_S2nd_S3rd_IO3rd_DO3rd_P1st_P2nd_IO1st_IO2nd_DO2nd_P1st_DO02004006008001,0001,2001,0571,035952464395168988777625123Figure 2 Combinations of person and grammatical functionTable 5 Distribution of cases in NAIST Text CorpusCase nom (≈S) acc (≈DO) dat (≈IO) TotalFrequency 45,451 6,932 1,959 54,342(%)(83.6)(12.8)(3.6)(100.0)its annotation scheme makes use of morphological caseinstead of grammatical function.
A comparison of Tables4 and 5 reveals two points.
First, subject is far more oftenrealized as zero than the other functions in both languages.
Second, a substantial diﬀerence exists concerning the pro-portion of indirect object: rather big in Malay and verysmall in Japanese.


5 Conclusion

This study has proposed a common scheme for zero pro-noun annotation designed to be used cross-linguisticallywith no prerequisite annotations.
We hope that it willcontribute to increasing the number of corpora with zeropronoun annotation, which will enrich our understandingof the linguistic properties of pro drop and help improvethe quality and quantity of related NLP research and de-velopment.
Regarding the Malay corpus, the same corpus has alsobeen given other kinds of annotations, namely morphology,ﬁrst and second person expressions, and address terms[22].
The zero pronoun annotation created by this studycan be combined with these other annotations to gain newinsights about the language.
An obvious limitation of thisstudy is the small size of the corpus, which is actually aproblem of Malay linguistics in general.
Since pro drop isa phenomena characteristic of spoken language in Malay,larger open spoken corpora are urgently needed.

A Other language speciﬁc consid-



erations



A.1 Verb + particle

The direct object of a verb accompanied by particles suchas lagi ‘more’, balik ‘back’, kembali ‘back’, semula ‘again’can occur either after the verb (6a) or between the verband the particle (6b).
We chose the former analysis in ourannotation scheme.(5) Taknotbolehcankurangdiscountlagimorekak?elder.sister‘Can’t you discount more, sis?’
[20](6) a. ✓ Tak boleh kurang 𝑒 lagi kak?b.
Tak boleh kurang lagi 𝑒 kak?

A.2 Serial verbs

Some serial verbs (V1V2) allow the object of V1to occureither after V1, as in (8a), or after V2, as in (8b).
We chosethe former analysis.(7) SayaIbarujustbawacarrykeluargo.outkejapfor.a.momenttadi.just.now‘I just took it out a moment ago.’
[20](8) a. ✓ Saya baru bawa 𝑒 keluar kejap tadi.b.
Saya baru bawa keluar 𝑒 kejap tadi.


A.3 Left dislocation vs. topicalization

Left dislocation refers to a construction in which thesentence-initial topic is repeated by a resumptive pronoun,as in (9a).
It diﬀers from topicalization in that the latterdoes not involve a resumptive pronoun, as in (9b).(9) a.
Left
dislocationYangrelmerahredituthatakuInakwantdia.it‘The red one, I want it.
’b.
TopicalizationYangrelmerahredituthatakuitnak.want‘As for the red one, I want.’Another diﬀerence is that only topicalization is subject tothe so-called island conditions.
Therefore, when the pro-noun is absent, only the left dislocation analysis is availableif islands are involved, as in (10).(10) a.
Yangrelmerahredituthatadabeorangpersonbeli.buy‘The red one, there’s a person who bought it.
’[20]b.
Yang merah itu ada orang beli 𝑒.However, if not, both left dislocation and topicalizationanalyses are possible.
In this case, we chose the left dislo-cation analysis.(11)
a. ✓
Yang merah itu aku nak 𝑒.b.
Yang merah itu aku nak.


A.4 Fixed expressions

Some ﬁxed expressions can be analysed as resulting fromomitting arguments.
However, we treat ﬁxed expressionsas not involving pro drop.(12)(Saya)ITaknotapa.what‘It’s OK.’(13) a. ✓
Tak apa.b.
𝑒 Tak apa.(14) Apawhatkhabarnews(awak)?your‘How are you?’(15) a. ✓
