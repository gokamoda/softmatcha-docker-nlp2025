Abstract

Personality is a fundamental psychological trait thatshapes an individual’s behavior patterns.
This paperproposes a novel approach to personality simulation,which aims to simulate some predeﬁned personalitytraits using large language models.
We conduct rep-resentation engineer ing and construct a set of person-ality control vectors to enable ﬁne-grained control ofthe strength of personality traits.
Additionally, we usea linear model to capture the interdependencies amongpersonality traits.
Evaluation based on a real-worldpersonality dataset shows that our proposed personal-ity simulation method outperforms the prompt-basedbaseline method.


1 Introduction

The vast amount of human-generated training datahas given large language models (LLMs) the ability toemulate human behaviors
[1, 2, 3].
This ability facil-itates the research on role-playing agents, whose goalis to simulate predeﬁned personas including person-alities, demographic traits, speciﬁc public ﬁgures orﬁctional entities, etc
[4].In this work, we focus on one of the most fundamen-tal tasks of role-playing — personality simulation andaim to endow LLM agents with predeﬁned personalitytraits.
Personality is a fundamental psychological traitthat inﬂuences how individuals interpret and react tothe world around them, consequently shaping their dis-tinctive behavioral, interaction, and decision-makingpatterns [ 5].
Modeling personality is especially cru-cial for psychological and sociological research.
Therealization of LLM personality simulation as proxiesof human behaviors opens new opportunities for an-alyzing human behavior in controlled, replicable, andscalable ways.
Most existing works on personality simulation uti-lize in-context learning and design prompts to in-ﬂict changes in personality traits exhibited by theLLM [6, 7, 8, 9].
For instance, Garcia et al.
[6] uti-lize personality-describing adjectives associated withdiﬀerent Big Five personality traits to induce variouspersonalities of LLMs [10].
However, these prompt-based approaches have several drawbacks.
First, it isdiﬃcult to control the strength of personality traits.
While it is possible to put modiﬁers such as ‘very’ and‘a bit’ in front of the personality-describing adjectivesfor strength control [6], the discrete nature of languagemakes it diﬃcult for more ﬁne-grained control.
Sec-ond, the complex dependencies between personalitytraits are overlooked.
Existing studies suggest that per-sonality traits are not mutually independent, and con-trolling one personality trait might induce changes inother personality traits as well
[6, 11].
However, itis diﬃcult to account for these interactions with theexisting prompt-based framework.
To address the above drawbacks, we propose a novelpersonality simulation approach based on representa-tion engineering [12].
Representation engineering isa technique designed to control the behavior of neuralnetwork models by introducing control vectors into thehidden states of the model during inference.
To adaptthis method for personality simulation, we ﬁrst derive aset of personality control vectors with the personality-describing adjectives from the Big Five personality the-ory.
These vectors enable the manipulation of modelbehavior to simulate distinct Big Five personality traits.
From the spanning vector space of the personality con-trol vectors, we sample control vectors and observe thechange in the overall personality proﬁle exhibited bythe controlled model.
We use a linear model to capturethe relation between the control vectors and the in-duced personality proﬁles.
Empirical results show that

Evaluation based on a real-world personalitydataset shows the superiority of our proposed methodover the prompt-based baseline method.


2 Personality Theory


In this work, we adopt the Big Five personality the-ory
[10]
and consider the following ﬁve personalitytraits: openness (OPE), conscientiousness (CON), ex-traversion (EXT), agreeableness (AGR), and neuroti-cism (NEU).
Altogether, these ﬁve personality traits en-compass a comprehensive range of human personalitypatterns.
These ﬁve personality traits are derived basedon the lexical hypothesis
[10, 13], with each Big Fivepersonality trait representing a cluster of personality-describing adjectives under factor analysis (Table 1).Note that the ﬁve personality traits are not binaryattributes but exist on a spectrum.
In psychology, self-report questionnaires are widely used for assessing thestrength of personality traits of an individual.
For in-stance, the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP)inventory is a commonly used personality test for as-sessing the strength of Big Five personality traits
[14].The IPIP inventory consists of 50 questions, each ques-tion measures the strength of a Big Five personality traiton a scale of 1 to 5.
For each Big Five personality trait𝑝, we take the average of the scores of all the corre-sponding questions 𝑠𝑝as the strength of 𝑝. Altogether,the strength scores of all Big Five personality traitsconstitute a 5-dimensional personality proﬁle:𝑆 = {𝑠𝑂𝑃𝐸, 𝑠𝐶𝑂𝑁, 𝑠𝐸𝑋𝑇, 𝑠𝐴𝐺 𝑅, 𝑠𝑁 𝐸𝑈} (1)

Proposed Method

In this section, we introduce our proposed method forLLM personality simulation.
Based on the representa-tion engineering, we ﬁrst deﬁne the personality controlvector space (Section 3.1).
We then sample vectors 𝑣from the personality control vector space and conduct asimulation to observe the exhibited personality proﬁle𝑆 of the controlled LLM agents (Section 3.2).


3.1 Personality Control Vector Space

For each Big Five personality trait, we take the listof corresponding personality describing adjectives andtheir antonyms to construct a personality control vec-tor.
Speciﬁcally, we construct an adjective control vec-tor for each adjective pair and take the average of themas the personality control vector.
The process is sum-marized below:Adjective Control Vectors We consider eachadjective 𝑎𝑝𝑖and its antonym ¯𝑎𝑝𝑖(corresponding tosome personality trait 𝑝) to generate pairs of contrast-ing prompts:Contrasting Prompt Pair(positive
prompt)Act like an extremely [𝑎𝑝𝑖] person andcomplete the sentence: [PREFIX](negative prompt)Act like an extremely [ ¯𝑎𝑝𝑖] person andcomplete the sentence: [PREFIX]We construct a set of 𝐾 contrasting prompt pairswith a set of 𝐾 preﬁxes.
For each preﬁx 𝑗, we collectmodel hidden states ℎ𝑗and¯ℎ𝑗of the positive and thenegative prompts and compute their diﬀerence ℎ𝑗−¯ℎ𝑗.We conduct principal component analysis (PCA) on theset of 𝐾 diﬀerence vectors and take the ﬁrst principalcomponent as the control vector 𝑣𝑝𝑖related to 𝑎𝑝𝑖.During inference, the control vector 𝑣𝑝𝑖could addedto the hidden state of the model for behavior control.
Theoretically, 𝑣𝑝𝑖has the eﬀect of modifying model be-havior along the spectrum deﬁned by the pair of adjec-tives 𝑎𝑝𝑖and ¯𝑎𝑝𝑖. Also, we can assert diﬀerent degreesof control by scaling the vector with diﬀerent scalarvalues 𝑐.
For instance, applying the vector der ived bythe adjective ‘friendly’ with a positive value of 𝑐 leadsto increasingly friendly behavior of the model, whileusing a negative value of 𝑐 elicits unfr iendly behaviors.
Personality Control VectorsFor each person-ality trait 𝑝, we consider the set of cor responding per-sonality describing adjectives {𝑎𝑝𝑖} and compute theircorresponding vectors {𝑣𝑝𝑖}.
We take the average ofthese adjective control vectors as the personality con-

trol vector:𝑣𝑝=∑𝑖𝑣𝑝𝑖(2)Since the adjectives represent diﬀerent aspects ofa personality trait, applying vector 𝑣𝑝with diﬀerentscalar values changes the strength of the personalitytrait 𝑝 exhibited by the model.
Personality Control Vector Space We deﬁnethe personality control vector space as the spanningvector space of the set of personality control vectors:{𝑣𝑝} = {𝑣𝑂𝑃𝐸, 𝑣𝐶𝑂𝑁, 𝑣𝐸𝑋𝑇, 𝑣𝐴𝐺𝑅, 𝑣𝑁 𝐸𝑈} (3)From this vector space, we can sample a control vector𝑣, which will be a linear combination of vectors in{𝑣𝑝}, where {𝑐𝑝} are the corresponding scalars:𝑣 =∑𝑝𝑐𝑝𝑣𝑝(4)

3.2 Simulation with Controlled Agents

After sampling a vector 𝑣 from the personality con-trol vector space, we apply it to an LLM and observethe personality exhibited by the controlled model.
Wemeasure the strength of personality traits of the con-trolled model with a self-report questionnaire.
Eachitem of the questionnaire consists of a statement suchas ‘I am the life of the par ty’, ‘I sympathize with others’feelings’.
Each statement is related to one of the BigFive personality traits.1）The controlled model is askedto rate how accurately a speciﬁc statement describes iton a scale of 1 to 5.
We collect the responses of theLLM agents with the following prompt:Prompt for personality testEvaluate the following statement:[STATEMENT].Please rate how accurately this describesyou on a scale from 1 to 5 (where 1 = "veryinaccurate", 2 = "moderately inaccurate",3 = "neither accurate nor inaccurate", 4= "moderately accurate", and 5 = "veryaccurate").
Please answer using EXACTLYone of the following: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.Based on the responses, we calculate the strength ofeach Big-Five personality trait on the scale of 1 to 5 asthe personality proﬁle 𝑆 of the controlled model.1）
The details could be found at https://ipip.ori.org/newBigFive5broadKey.htm.We randomly sample 𝑁 control vectors and ob-serve the resulting personality proﬁles of the con-trolled model.
In this fashion, we obtain 𝑁 pairs ofcorresponding control vectors and personality proﬁles{(𝑣𝑛, 𝑆𝑛)}.
We represent each control vector as itscorresponding scalar values (Eq. 4) and each proﬁle asstrengths of Big-Five personality traits (Eq. 1).
Fur-ther, we use this data to ﬁt a linear model between thescalar values {𝑐𝑝} and the resulting personality traitstrengths {𝑠𝑝}:𝑠𝑝=∑𝑥∈𝐵𝐼𝐺−5𝑐𝑥𝑤𝑥 𝑝+ 𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠𝑝(5)The weight 𝑤𝑥𝑦captures how a personality controlvector 𝑣𝑥aﬀects the strength of personality trait 𝑠𝑦.With this model, we can model the interdependenciesbetween diﬀerent Big Five personality traits.
Also,given a designated proﬁle 𝑆 = {𝑠𝑝}, we can use themodel to ﬁnd the optimal set of scalars {𝑐𝑝} and con-struct the control vector based on Eq. 4.

4 Experimental Settings

The following are the experimental settings.
LLM Model We adopted the Mistral-7B models,which contains a total of 32 layers.
Control Vector We obtained and applied the con-trol vectors based on the hidden states of the 15𝑡 ℎlayer.
A general preﬁx set of size
𝐾 = 582 provided by [12]is used.
Since applying control vectors of large magni-tude causes performance degradation, we sampled thescalars of control vectors from the uniform distribu-tion within the range of [−3.0, 3.0].
𝑁 = 200 controlvectors are sampled to ﬁt the linear model.
Evaluation
We use the real-human dataset pro-vided by the Open-Source Psychometrics Project,which contains over 1M personality proﬁles collectedanonymously through an online personality test web-site2）.
We sampled 200 personality proﬁles from thedataset and used our proposed method to simulate eachproﬁle.
We compared the strength of personality traitsexhibited by the model to the real value provided bythe proﬁle.
For each Big-Five personality trait, wecalculate the mean of the absolute error between thereal personality strength and the simulated personalitystrength as an evaluation metric.
Baseline We compared our proposed personal-ity simulation method with the previous prompt-based2）

For the baseline method,prompts are used instead of the control vectors to con-trol the LLM model.


5 Results and Analysis

We introduce the evaluation results of our proposedpersonality simulation method (Section 5.1).
In ad-dition, we conduct an analysis of the personality traitinterdependencies based on the weights of the linearmodel (Section 5.2).


5.1 Personality Simulation Evaluation

We compare the eﬀectiveness of our proposed per-sonality simulation method with the baseline method.
Table 2 shows the mean absolute error for each of theﬁve Big Five personality traits.
Our proposed personality simulation method outper-forms the previous prompt-based method with a lowerabsolute error value for most personality traits exceptfor agreeableness.
The proposed method achieved a0.275 points deviation (on a scale of 1 to 5) on aver-age, signiﬁcantly lower than the average error of 0.511points of the prompt-based baseline.
The empirical re-sult illustrates the eﬀectiveness of our proposed methodin achieving ﬁne-grained control of personality.


5.2 Analysis of Personality Traits In-



terdependencies

, we analyze the interdependencies betweenthe ﬁve personality traits.
Figure 1 shows the heatmap of the weights of the linear model, where thepositive weights are highlighted in red and the negativeweights are in blue.
With this visualization, we cansee how each personality vector aﬀects the strength ofpersonality traits (the IPIP scores).We ﬁrst observe the diagonal elements of the heatmap.

The only exception is the OPEpersonality trait, which is most strongly aﬀected bythe EXT personality vector, while the OPE personalityvector only exerts a very small positive eﬀect on it.
For the oﬀ-diagonal elements, the weights are gen-erally smaller in magnitude, signifying a smaller in-ﬂuence of the personality vector across personalitytraits.
Nevertheless, there exist several exceptions ofoﬀ-diagonal weights of large magnitude, signifyingstronger interdependence between personality traits:• The CON vector has a signiﬁcant positive inﬂu-ence on the AGR trait and a negative inﬂuence onthe NEU trait exhibited by the model.•
The EXT vector has a signiﬁcant positive inﬂu-ence on both OPE and AGR personality traits.•
The NEU vector has a signiﬁcant negative inﬂu-ence on both CON and AGR personality traits.
The above analysis shows the importance of model-ing interdependence between personality traits.


6 Conclusion

In this work, we proposed a novel personality sim-ulation method based on representation engineering.
We construct a set of personality control vectors to con-trol the strength of Big-Five personality traits exhibitedby the model.
To capture the interdependence of thepersonality traits, we build a simple linear model toconsider the contribution of the personality vectors toeach personality trait.
Evaluation based on a real-worldpersonality dataset shows that our proposed methodoutperforms the previous prompt-based method.
